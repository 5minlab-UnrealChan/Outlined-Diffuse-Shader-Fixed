# Outlined Diffuse Shader Fixed for Unity 5.6
This is a fixed version of diffused outline shader from http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Outlined_Diffuse_3
(If the link is still broken, try cache:http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Outlined_Diffuse_3 )

It should be working fine in Unity 5.6.

There are two versions of the shader, I use them for different objects, sometimes the custom one works best and sometimes the regular one.
Regular one is just an updated version of the older Outlined Diffuse 3, while the custom one is slightly modified so that it scales the whole vertex. Just try out both of them :)
