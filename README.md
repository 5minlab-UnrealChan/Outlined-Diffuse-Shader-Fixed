# Outlined Diffuse Shader Fixed for Unity 5.6
This is a fixed version of diffused outline shader from http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Outlined_Diffuse_3
(If the link is still broken, try cache:http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Outlined_Diffuse_3 )
It should is working fine in Unity 5.6.

There are two main versions of the shader, I use them for different objects, sometimes the custom one works best and sometimes the regular one. Just try out both of them :)

||| * RegularOutline.shader - Just an updated version of the shader |||
|||                           from the wiki page, may still work    |||
|||                           in weird ways => if so, use custom one|||
||| * CustomOutline.shader -  My personal take on the outline shader|||
|||                           It increases the size of the vertex   |||
|||                           instead of working with normals.      |||
||| * CustomOutline-CameraIndependent.shader - Same as custom one,  |||
|||                           but it is the same width despite the  |||
|||                           distance to the camera.               |||
