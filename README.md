# Outlined Diffuse Shader Fixed for Unity 5.6
This is a fixed version of diffused outline shader from http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Outlined_Diffuse_3
(If the link is still broken, try cache:http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Outlined_Diffuse_3 )
It should is working fine in Unity 5.6.
There are two main versions of the shader, I use them for different objects, sometimes the custom one works best and sometimes the regular one. Just try out both of them :)


# Shaders:                         
**RegularOutline.shader** - Just an updated version of the shader from the wiki page, may still work in weird ways => if so, use custom one.
![Regular Outline](/images/standard.PNG?raw=true "Regular Outline")
**Usage**: Curved shapes/thin outlines.
**Problems**: Weird shapes on hard edges.

---

**CustomOutline.shader** - My personal take on the outline shader. It increases the scale of the vertices instead of working with normals. 
![Custom Outline](/images/custom.PNG?raw=true "Custom Outline")
**Usage**: Hard edges/thick outlines
**Problems**: Possible clipping on really thick edges.

---

**CustomOutline-CameraIndependent.shader** - Same as custom one, but the outline is the same width despite the distance to the camera. 

![Camera Independend Close](/images/camera.PNG?raw=true "Camera Independend Close")
![Camera Independend Far](/images/camera2.PNG?raw=true "Camera Independend Far")

**Usage**: Same sized outline on perspective camera.
**Problems**: Weird shapes on complex objects.

---

**CustomOutline-ConstantWidth.shader** - Same as custom one, but the outline is constant width despite the camera zoom.

![Constant Width Zoomed In](/images/zoom2.PNG?raw=true "Constant Width Zoomed In")
![Constant Width Zoomed Out](/images/zoom.PNG?raw=true "Constant Width Zoomed Out")

**Usage**: Same outline width despite the camera's zoom (ortho/perspective)
**Problems**: Clipping on thick outlines on complex shapes.

*UPDATE 03.09.2017 - Added camera independent version of custom shader*
*UPDATE 04.09.2017 - Added constant size version of custom shader | updated README to include images*
